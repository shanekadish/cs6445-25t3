Had pretty much no issues installing Windows 11 VM using VMWare Fusion on Apple Silicon Mac. Just used all defaults. Then followed Andrew's steps and video here: https://discourse01.cse.unsw.edu.au/25T3/COMP6445/t/preparing-for-week-2/38

64GB seemed not to be enough when extracting m57biz. Changed to 100GB but think I now need to reinstall Windows VM because I can't extend C drive since they're not contiguous.

MAKE SURE TO CLICK CUSTOMIZE AT THE END OF WINDOWS 11 INSTALLATION DIALOGUE AND MAKE IT > 80GB. I MADE MINE 100.
